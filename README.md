Delivery App Choices
Activism
As everything shuts down and people rely more on delivery/carryout instead of eating out, please remember that you have, as is too rarely the case, a chance to support Asians. Below are some of the major food apps and their Asian representation. Feel free to add others.

Restaurant delivery:

Chowbus: Asian founder and leadership; privately held.

DoorDash (including Caviar): three (of four) Asian co-founders, with an Asian CEO; privately held but in the process of going public, with a most recent valuation of $12.6 billion.

Grubhub (including Seamless): not founded by any Asians; no Asian leadership.
